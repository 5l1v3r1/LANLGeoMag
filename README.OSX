The configure on OSX to use the openmp that is in Lgm required that the 64 bit xcode is installed.  Get xcode4 (http://asus.lanl.gov/html/sucs.php).

Then at least on RBSP2 I have to specify a lib path in ./configure to make it work.
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/x86_64"



This package also comes with Python wrappers. To install these it is highly
recommended to install the ctypesgen package first.
Then:
$ cd Python
$ python setup.py install [--user]
